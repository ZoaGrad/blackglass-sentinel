# Blackglass Sentinel

## Industrial. Sovereign. High-Agency.

**Blackglass Sentinel** is an AI-native observability tool designed for the uncompromising SRE. It bridges the gap between raw telemetry from Honeycomb.io and the human cost of reliability engineering.

### The Manifesto

In modern "Hero Culture," engineers are sacrificed at the altar of uptime. We normalize sleep deprivation as a badge of honor. **Sentinel fixes this.**

By integrating human fatigue context directly into the decision-making loop, Sentinel enforces a "Mercy Protocol." When the system detects a latency breach during the witching hours (23:00 - 07:00 MT), it doesn't just page a human—it executes autonomous defense.

Sentinel is not just a bot; it is a sovereign agent for the engineer's well-being.

### Features

- **Entropy Vector Scanning**: High-cardinality analysis of Honeycomb telemetry to identify user-specific impact.
- **Human Cost Assessment**: Real-time evaluation of responder availability based on localized fatigue data.
- **Automated Defense Protocols**: Deterministic orchestration of system responses (Paging, Rolling back, or Watching).
